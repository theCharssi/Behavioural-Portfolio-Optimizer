Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  Project: Behaviour al Portfolio Optimizer  
Task:  Develop a  Behaviour al finance platform that detects investor biases, adjusts portfolio  
optimization algorithms accordingly, and provides personalized nudges to improve  investment 
decisions.  
 
Deliverables  
 
Part 1 (Foundation & Setup): Private repository with React/Next.js frontend, Python/FastAPI 
backend for ML models, PostgreSQL database for user data, bias detection framework 
architecture, integration with brokerage APIs (Alpaca/Interactive Brokers), authentication system 
with portfolio connection, initial data pipeline for transaction history analysis, Behaviour al 
finance literature review and bias taxonomy (overconfidence, loss aversion, recency bias, 
confirmation bias, herd mentality, anchoring), machine learning model selection (Random 
Forest, Neural Networks, NLP for sentiment), deployed development environment with CI/CD 
pipeline.  
 
Part 2 (Bias Detection System): ML models trained on historical trading patterns to detect 8+ 
investor biases, transaction analysis engine identifying timing patterns, holding periods, panic 
selling, FOMO buying, natural language processing on user notes and research queries, bias 
scoring dashboard showing individual bias intensity (0 -100 scale), real -time bias detection 
during active trading sessions, comparison against rational investor baseline, bias correlation 
analysis across portfolio decisions, automated bias reports with historical trends, API endpoints 
for bias data retrieval, 85%+ detection accuracy validated against Behaviour al economics 
research.  
 
Part 3 (Portfolio Optimization): Bias -adjusted Modern Portfolio Theory implementation, multi -
objective optimization considering expected return, risk tolerance, and detected biases, dynamic 
asset allocation adjusting for overconfidence (reducing leverage), loss aversion (tactical stop -
losses), recency bias (mean reversion signals), Monte Carlo simulations incorporating 
Behaviour al factors, risk -adjusted return calculations (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max 
drawdown), rebalancing recommendations accounting for disposition effect, tax -loss harvesting 
with Behaviour al nudges, portfolio stress testing under user -specific bias scenarios, comparison 
of traditional vs bias -adjusted portfolios showing 12 -18% better risk -adjusted returns.  
 
Part 4 (Nudge & Recommendation System): Personalized notification engine delivering timely 
Behaviour al interventions, context -aware nudges triggered by detected bias patterns (e.g., "You 
tend to sell winners too early - consider holding 30 days more"), cooling -off period suggestions ZeTheta Algorithms Private Limited

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  Project:  Behaviour al Portfolio Optimizer  
Comprehensive Training & Implementation Guide  
 
PART I: LEARNING RESOURCES & FUNDAMENTALS  
 
Chapter 1: Behaviour al Portfolio Optimization  
 
1.1 Traditional Portfolio Optimization vs Behaviour al Approaches  
 
Traditional Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT):  
 
Framework:  
- Assumes rational investors  
- Uses historical mean returns and covariances  
- Maximizes returns for given risk level  
- Efficient frontier drives allocation  
 
Limitations:  
Human reality vs MPT assumptions:  
- Investors are emotional, not rational  
- Risk perception ≠ statistical risk  
- Recency bias: Recent performance overweighted  
- Loss aversion: Losses feel 2.25x worse than gains  
- Status quo bias: Reluctant to change allocation  
- Overconfidence: Overestimate alpha -generating ability  
 
Behaviour al Portfolio Optimization:  
 
Incorporates:  
- Investor psychology and biases  
- Regret theory (avoiding past mistakes)  
- Prospect theory (reference points matter)  
- Attention constraints (limited mental capacity)  
- Narrative/story -based allocation  
 
Result: Portfolios that actual humans will stick with

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  1.2 Components of Behaviour al Portfolio Optimization  
 
Loss Aversion in Portfolio Construction  
 
Theory:  
- Losses loom larger than gains (2.25:1 ratio)  
- Reference point determines gains vs losses  
- Creates preference for "sure thing" over lottery  
 
Application:  
Traditional allocation: 60/40 stocks/bonds  
Expected volatility: 10% annually  
Worst case drawdown: -30% possible  
 
Investor's reaction: "30% loss is unacceptable!"  
Behaviour al response: Reduce stock allocation  
 
Behaviour al optimization:  
- Set loss targets that feel acceptable  
- Design portfolio to meet those targets  
- Even if mathematically suboptimal  
- But psychologically sustainable  
 
Regret Minimization  
 
Theory:  
- Investors regret missing gains more than losses  
- Past opportunity haunts more than past mistakes  
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)  
 
Application in Portfolio:  
Scenario: Tech stocks outperform 5 years  
 
Traditional allocation: 5% to tech (efficiency)  
Investor regret: "Why didn't I own more tech?"  
Behaviour al allocation: 15% tech (regret minimization)

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  Consequence:  
- Higher concentration risk  
- But less regret  
- Psychologically sustainable  
 
Key insight: Regret minimization ≠ regret maximization  
 
Reference Dependence  
 
Theory:  
- People evaluate wealth relative to reference point  
- Not absolute level  
- Reference point adapts slowly (stickiness)  
 
Application:  
Investor portfolio: $1,000,000 at start  
Year 1: Portfolio grows 20% → $1,200,000  
NEW REFERENCE POINT: $1,200,000 expected  
 
Year 2: Portfolio earns 5% → $1,260,000  
Perceived outcome: Underperformance (5% vs expected 20%)  
Emotional response: Disappointment, not satisfaction  
 
Behaviour al optimization:  
- Acknowledge reference point shifts  
- Adjust targets based on anchors  
- Psychologically manage expectations  
 
Mental Accounting in Portfolio  
 
Theory:  
- Investors segregate portfolio into "buckets"  
- Different rules for different buckets  
- "Household finance" mentality  
 
Behaviour al Application:  
Mental buckets:  ZeTheta Algorithms Private Limited

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  1. Safety bucket: Cash, bonds (must not lose)  
2. Growth bucket: Stocks (accept volatility)  
3. Speculation bucket: Options, crypto (lottery)  
 
Portfolio allocation:  
- 50% to safety (feel secure)  
- 40% to growth (invest for retirement)  
- 10% to speculation (lottery fun)  
 
Efficient? No (more bonds than optimal)  
Sustainable? Yes (meets psychological needs)  
 
Attention Constraints  
 
Theory:  
- Limited mental capacity for decisions  
- Complex portfolios ignored; simple ones monitored  
- Concentrated holdings receive more attention  
 
Behaviour al Application:  
Optimal portfolio: 40 holdings across sectors  
Problem: Investor can't monitor all  
 
Behaviour al portfolio: 8 holdings  
- Concentrated enough for attention  
- Diversified enough for risk  
- Actively monitored  
- Higher engagement  
 
Trade -off: More concentrated risk  
But: Better execution (better timing, more rebalancing)

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation   
Safety Layer (Bottom):  
- Capital preservation  
- Bonds, cash, insurance  
- Ensures minimum acceptable outcome  
- Never regret being safe  
 
Potential Layer (Middle):  
- Growth opportunity  
- Diversified portfolio  
- Expected return focus  
- Accepts volatility  
 
Aspiration Layer (Top):  
- Lottery tickets  
- Out-of-the-money options  
- Speculative stocks  
- Potential for wealth acceleration  
 
Portfolio construction:  
Start with safety (bonds covering 2 years expenses)  
Add growth (core holdings in index funds)  
Add aspirational (high -risk/reward plays)  
 
Result: Psychologically coherent portfolio  
vs Mathematically optimal MPT portfolio  
 
Kahneman & Tversky Prospect Theory  
 
Value Function:  
- S-shaped curve (asymmetric)  
- Concave for gains (diminishing returns)  
- Convex for losses (increasing sensitivity)  
- Loss aversion (steeper for losses)  
 
Portfolio Application:

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  - Additional gains feel less valuable  
- Suggests selling winners (lock in gains)  
- Problem: Gives up upside  
 
Loss domain (portfolio down):  
- Additional losses feel worse  
- Suggests holding losers (avoid crystallizing loss)  
- Problem: Let losers run  
 
Behaviour al portfolio design:  
- Account for these asymmetries  
- Design rebalancing that works with (not against) psychology  
- Acknowledge that some suboptimality is price of adherence  
 
CPT (Cumulative Prospect Theory) Application:  
Portfolio probability weighting:  
- Common outcomes: Normal probability  
- Rare outcomes: Overweighted probability  
- Leads to insurance -like Behaviour  
 
Example:  
Black swan event probability: 0.1% (1 -in-1000)  
Investor perception: 2 -3% (overweighting tail risk)  
Portfolio result: More defensive positioning  
Trade -off: Cost of insurance (lower returns)  
Benefit: Peace of mind (prevents panic selling)  
 
1.4 Risk Measurement in Behaviour al Context  
 
Statistical Risk vs Perceived Risk  
 
VaR (Value at Risk):  
- Statistical measure: "5% chance of loss ≥ $X"  
- Doesn't account for investor psychology  
- May not match investor's risk tolerance

Phone: +91 -9136249369   
 
Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation  - Maximum loss investor psychologically accepts  
- Often lower than statistical risk  
- Sets true allocation constraints  
 
Example:  
Portfolio volatility: 15% annually  
VaR 95% confidence: Maximum annual loss = 25%  
 
Investor acceptable loss: 10%  
Implication: 15% volatility too high  
 
Solution: Reduce allocation until volatility ≤ 10%  
Even if statistically suboptimal  
 
 
Drawdown Tolerance  
 
Maximum Drawdown:  
- Largest peak -to-trough decline  
- Matters more to investors than volatility  
- More psychologically relevant  
 
 
Portfolio A: 10% volatility, 15% maximum drawdown  
Portfolio B: 10% volatility, 30% maximum drawdown  
 
Mathematically: Same risk  
Psychologically: Portfolio A preferred  
Reason: Worst -case scenario less scary  
 
Behaviour al optimization prioritizes max drawdown

Strictly Private and Confidential – Not for Circulation   
Player must:  
- Decide when to rebalance  
- Choose which positions to adjust  
- Manage tax implications  
- Handle regret (selling winners)  
 
Scoring:  
- Cost minimization (taxes, fees)  
- Return maximization (staying invested)  
- Risk maintenance (keeping allocation)  
 
Challenge 3: Investor Preference Matching  
 
Different investor profiles have different needs:  
- Retiree: Capital preservation, income  
- Growth investor: Max returns, accept volatility  
- Balanced: Both growth and stability  
- Speculator: Exciting positions, upside  
 
Player given investor profile  
Must create allocation that:  
- Meets financial objectives  
- Aligns with psychological preferences  
- Is sustainable long -term 
 
Scoring:  
- Objective achievement (return targets)  
- Preference satisfaction (psychological comfort)  
- Sustainability (likely to stay invested)

Chapter 3: Advanced Topics  
 
3.1 Dynamic Allocation Based on Regret  
 
Regret -Adjusted Rebalancing:  
 
 
Traditional rule: Rebalance when 5% drift  
Regret -adjusted rule:  
- Rebalance drifts into losses earlier (regret avoidance)  
- Rebalance drifts into gains later (regret of selling winners)  
 
Result: Asymmetric rebalancing that matches psychology  
 
3.2 Narrative -Based Portfolio Construction  
 
Story -Driven Allocation:  
 
Instead of: "60% stocks, 40% bonds"  
Narrative: "Core holdings (60%) for retirement,  
           Bond safety net (40%) for unexpected needs"  
 
Better psychological understanding  
More sustainable long -term 
 
3.3 Peer Comparison and Status Effects  
 
Reference Group Effects:  
 
Investor compares to peer group  
If underperforming: Regret, desire to take more risk  
If overperforming: Satisfaction, confidence maintained
